# Reusable Form Builder with TypeScript

This is a frontend project to build forms in a way that is highly flexible and therefore reusable. It is simple to use and has potential to save a lot of time and effort when implementing forms. My main goal in creating this app was to continue improving my understanding of TypeScript while building something useful and simple that I can use to reduce code reuse and improve productivity in future projects.

Since the current iteration's purpose is focused on improving my TS skills, the app does not implement any API calls. It merely displays an alert to simulate an API response. For example, a successful form validation will trigger an alert, "Success! Form was submitted." To simulate a failed validation, I display an alert that contains all of the relevant error messages. For example, a failure simulation will display and alert with a message similar to, "Form submission failed: Invalid email format."

Future improvements will include adding code to implement API calls to a server.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
